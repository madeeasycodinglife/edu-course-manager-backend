# Microservices API Documentation IIT-Bombay Assignment

This repository contains various microservices with their respective APIs for authentication, user management, course management, and instance management. The services are designed with Spring Boot and secured using JWT tokens.

## Services Overview

### 1. Auth Service
Handles user authentication, including sign-up, sign-in, token refresh, and logout.

- **Sign-Up**: `POST /auth-service/sign-up`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
        "fullName": "Pabitra Bera",
        "email": "pabitra@gmail.com",
        "password": "Apabitra@123",
        "phone": "8101187317",
        "roles": ["ADMIN"]
      }
      ```
- **Refresh Token**: `POST /auth-service/refresh-token/{token}`
- **Sign-In**: `POST /auth-service/sign-in`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
        "email": "pabitra@gmail.com",
        "password": "Ap@123"
      }
      ```
- **Log-Out**: `POST /auth-service/log-out`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
        "email": "pabitra@gmail.com",
        "accessToken": "{your_access_token}"
      }
      ```
- **Validate Token**: `POST /auth-service/validate-access-token/{token}`

### 2. User Service
Manages user details and profile updates.

- **Get User Details**: `GET /user-service/{email}`
    - Requires Bearer Token in the Authorization header.
- **Partial Update User**: `PATCH /user-service/partial-update/{email}`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
        "fullName": "Pabitra Bera",
        "email": "pabitra@gmail.com",
        "password": "Apabitra@123",
        "phone": "8101187317",
        "roles": ["ADMIN"]
      }
      ```

### 3. Course Service
Handles course creation and management.

- **Create Course**: `POST /api/courses`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
        "title": "Introduction to Computer Architecture",
        "courseCode": "CS 102",
        "description": "This course provides a basic introduction to the architecture and algorithms of computer systems."
      }
      ```
- **Delete Course**: `DELETE /api/courses/{courseId}`

### 4. Instance Service
Manages course instances based on year and semester.

- **Create Instance**: `POST /api/instances`
    - Request Body:
      ```json
      {
        "year": 2023,
        "semester": 1,
        "courseId": 1
      }
      ```
- **Get Instance by Year and Semester**: `GET /api/instances/{year}/{semester}`
- **Get Instance by Year, Semester, and Course ID**: `GET /api/instances/{year}/{semester}/{courseId}`
- **Delete Instance by Year, Semester, and Course ID**: `DELETE /api/instances/{year}/{semester}/{courseId}`

### 5. Config Server
Handles configuration updates and propagates changes across services.

- **Bus Refresh**: `POST /actuator/busrefresh`
    - Used to refresh dynamic configurations across microservices.

## Authentication and Authorization

**Important:** Many endpoints in these microservices require authentication and authorization. Access to these endpoints is role-specific, and attempting to access a restricted endpoint without the proper credentials or roles will result in an access denial.

- Ensure you include a valid JWT token in the Authorization header for endpoints that require it.
- Roles are dynamically managed and can be updated by modifying the configuration file in the GitHub repository. After updating roles, you can propagate the changes across all services by hitting the `POST /actuator/busrefresh` endpoint on the Config Server.


To include the information about accessing the H2 databases in the `README.md` file, you can add a dedicated section explaining how to access each service's H2 database through the `h2-console`, along with the default credentials and datasource URLs. Here's how you can update your `README.md` file:

---

## Accessing H2 Databases

Each microservice in this project is configured with an in-memory H2 database that can be accessed via a web interface. The H2 database can be accessed through the `/h2-console` endpoint of each service.

### Default Credentials

- **Username**: `sa`
- **Password**: `sa`

### H2 Database URLs

Below are the datasource URLs for each service:

1. **Auth Service**
    - **Datasource URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:auth-service`
    - **Access Console**: [http://localhost:<auth-service-port>/h2-console](http://localhost:<auth-service-port>/h2-console)

2. **Instance Service**
    - **Datasource URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:instance-service`
    - **Access Console**: [http://localhost:<instance-service-port>/h2-console](http://localhost:<instance-service-port>/h2-console)

3. **Course Service**
    - **Datasource URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:course-service`
    - **Access Console**: [http://localhost:<course-service-port>/h2-console](http://localhost:<course-service-port>/h2-console)

4. **User Service**
    - **Datasource URL**: `jdbc:h2:mem:user-service`
    - **Access Console**: [http://localhost:<user-service-port>/h2-console](http://localhost:<user-service-port>/h2-console)

### How to Access the H2 Console

1. Start the microservices using Docker or your preferred method.
2. Open a web browser.
3. Navigate to the `/h2-console` endpoint of the desired service, for example, `http://localhost:8083/h2-console` for the `auth-service`.
4. Enter the credentials (`sa`/`sa`).
5. Use the corresponding datasource URL from the list above to connect to the database.

### Note

- Replace `<auth-service-port>`, `<instance-service-port>`, `<course-service-port>`, and `<user-service-port>` with the actual ports on which the respective services are running.
- Ensure that the service is up and running before accessing the H2 console.

## Prerequisites

- Java 17+
- Maven 3.8+
- Docker (for containerization optional if you use docker-compose file then use Docker)

## Running the Services

you can use Docker Compose to run all services together:

```bash
docker-compose up --build
